           <b> Computer Aided Language Learning (CALL)</b> <i> have gained popularity due to the flexibility they provide in empowering 
students to practice their language skills at their own pace. Detection/Correction of specific pronunciation error is an important 
component of an effective language learning system. Learning the correct rules of the Holy Quran recitation is important to every 
Muslim. In this work, we developed a Computer Aided Quranic Recitation Training system to detect errors in continuous 
recitation of Holy Quran and increase the accuracy of the error detection. We have integrated Automatic Speech Recognition 
(ASR) and classifier-based approach to detect recitation errors. </i>
        </p>

        <p>
            Error detection is done in two successive stages: first, an HMMbased ASR recognizes the recitation, detects the insertion, deletion and substitution of phones and provides phonetic time 
alignments, and then classifier based approach is used to distinguish between confusing phones to achieve improved detection 
rate. In this implementation we implemented only two classifiers, one to discriminate between emphasized and non-emphasized 
utterances of the letter “R” in Arabic, and the other to distinguish between closely related, often confused letter pronunciations.
