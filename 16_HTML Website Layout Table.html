                    <p>Computer Aided Language Learning (CALL) systems have gained popularity due to the flexibility they provide in empowering 
                        students to practice their language skills at their own pace. Detection/Correction of specific pronunciation error is an important 
                        component of an effective language learning system. Learning the correct rules of the Holy Quran recitation is important to every 
                        Muslim. In this work, we developed a Computer Aided Quranic Recitation Training system to detect errors in continuous 
                        recitation of Holy Quran and increase the accuracy of the error detection. We have integrated Automatic Speech Recognition 
                        (ASR) and classifier-based approach to detect recitation errors.
