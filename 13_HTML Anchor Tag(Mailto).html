            Error detection is done in two successive stages: first, an HMMbased ASR recognizes the recitation, detects the insertion, deletion and substitution of phones and provides phonetic time 
alignments, and then classifier based approach is used to distinguish between confusing phones to achieve improved detection 
rate. In this implementation we implemented only two classifiers, one to discriminate between emphasized and non-emphasized 
utterances of the letter “R” in Arabic, and the other to distinguish between closely related, often confused letter pronunciations.
